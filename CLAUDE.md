# RightsGuard - NVIDIA AI Agent Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
Multi-agent system that helps tenants identify lease violations and generate legal complaint letters using NVIDIA NeMo and GPU acceleration.

## Key Commands
```bash
# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application  
streamlit run app.py

# Test agents individually
python -m agents.scraper_agent
python -m agents.analyzer_agent  
python -m agents.letter_agent
```

## Architecture
```
User Input â†’ WebScraperAgent â†’ AnalyzerAgent â†’ LetterAgent â†’ Output
```

## Progress Tracking

### âœ… Completed
- [x] GitHub repo setup
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Requirements.txt with NVIDIA stack (NeMo, Guardrails, LangChain)
- [x] .gitignore configured
- [x] CLAUDE.md created
- [x] Python virtual environment setup
- [x] WebScraperAgent (web scraping + NYC Open Data API)
- [x] HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
- [x] Legal text extraction from multiple sources

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Adding real NVIDIA NIM integration to AnalyzerAgent

### âœ… Recently Completed
- [x] AnalyzerAgent skeleton with AI simulation
- [x] Legal prompt building for NVIDIA LLM
- [x] Structured analysis output (case strength, evidence needed)
- [x] Test integration between WebScraperAgent and AnalyzerAgent

### ðŸ“‹ Todo
- [ ] AnalyzerAgent with NeMo Guardrails
- [ ] LetterAgent with templates
- [ ] LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
- [ ] Streamlit UI
- [ ] NVIDIA NeMo integration
- [ ] Brev.dev GPU deployment
- [ ] Demo preparation

## Technical Notes
- Using Brev.dev GPU for acceleration
- NeMo Guardrails for legal safety
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- Focus: NYC tenant rights only for MVP

## Demo Script
1. User pastes lease text
2. Show agents collaborating in real-time
3. Output professional letter with legal citations
4. Emphasize GPU acceleration and safety guardrails

## API Keys Needed
- NVIDIA NIM API key (from hackathon)
- Brev.dev GPU access

## Learning Approach
- Building step-by-step with understanding
- User writes code with guidance, not copy-paste
- Focus on understanding each component before moving forward

## Key Concepts Learned
- **APIs vs Web Scraping**: APIs give structured data, scraping parses HTML
- **Response objects**: `.text` for content, `.status_code` for success/failure
- **Virtual environments**: Isolate project dependencies
- **Agent architecture**: Each agent has specific responsibility

## AnalyzerAgent Design Questions
1. What information does this agent need to make decisions?
   - User's complaint
   - Lease text
   - Scraped laws
   - Building violation history
   
2. How should it compare complaint to laws?
   - Keyword matching (simple)
   - Semantic similarity (advanced)
   - NVIDIA NIM for understanding
   
3. What format for results?
   - Structured dict with violations found
   - Confidence scores
   - Recommended actions

## Timeline
- Tonight: Setup + basic scraper
- Tomorrow: 4-hour build sprint during hackathon
